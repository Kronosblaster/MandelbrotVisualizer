# MandelbrotVisualizer
This is a roject created as part of an academic assignment. The source is written by me while the the project report was compiled by Deena Mariya, CET ECE, 2025.
The project visualises the mandelbrot set via a webapp. 

#Running
You can run this project by running the launcher file.
Remember to mark the launcher as an exectuable file.
### `chmod +x ./launcher.py`
Open a terminal in the downloaded directory and run the follinw command.
### `./launcher.py`

Methods to run the front end and backend individually are described in their respective README files.
The backend also provides for an animate.py file which when run generates a set of frames that zooms into the mandelbrot set visualisation.
